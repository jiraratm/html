       <p> While in the university I have joined Good thinking for good life of Christian club.<br> I was the MC of this
        event. It's new challenge.
        I'm too shy to speak in front audience but everything goes well <br> I learned a lot from this club. In my
        chruch, I'm in a program team. <br>
        The program team will coordinate with the MC, media team, worship team, and other people involved in the
        event.<br>
        The program team is also responsible for controlling the timing of each activity as appropriate. <br>
        during important festivals I've done other things like acting. Including helping to arrange the location and
        preparing equipment for camp. <br>
        Learn to work with others, learned to be a leader and learn how to succeed together.</p>
